Using satellite images from the Landsat mission and processing them through GPT-4 Vision, scientists have found faint linear clearings in the Upper Xingu Basin of Mato Grosso, Brazil. These subtle features, confirmed through NDVI analysis, suggest the existence of geometric landworks that could conceivably be of pre-Columbian origin. The anomalies lie within areas where vegetation is different from the surrounding forest, thereby enhancing the possibility of human intervention. The linear orders match known archaeological settlement patterns particularly with nearby locations such as Kuhikugu, an old assemblage of villages and roads. This particular evidence adds to a growing number of recent, arguing for past extensive, organized societies with sophisticated land-use systems existing in the Amazon. Combining satellites with AI-based image analysis, this particular study brings to light how state-of-the-art technology has helped reveal stone remains of lost civilizations beneath the forest canopy, further reviving knowledge about Amazonian prehistory.
